  "political_dynamics": "The coalition (VVD/D66) balanced deregulation with progressive demands, while GroenLinks-PvdA tested its limits. NSC emerged as a critical voice on fiscal equity, and the PVV remained strategically silent on technocratic issues.

    "NSC may continue its fiscal critiques, potentially aligning with opposition on specific issues.",
    "PVV is expected to re-engage on immigration/security themes in future sessions."
