  "executive_summary": "The 90th parliamentary meeting on June 3, 2025, revealed a complex interplay of coalition discipline and opposition tactics, with defense spending, climate policy, and social welfare emerging as key battlegrounds. The VVD and NSC maintained cohesion on foreign policy but faced fractures on domestic issues, while opposition parties like PVV and DENK prepared for culture-war clashes. Progressive parties demonstrated unity but struggled to influence budget decisions, signaling a shift toward issue-based alliances beyond traditional left-right divides.",
