  "executive_summary": "The 63rd parliamentary meeting on March 13, 2025, highlighted tensions within the coalition (NSC, CDA) and between the coalition and opposition (GroenLinks-PvdA, D66) over European integration, fiscal policy, and youth care reforms. Strategic positioning was evident, with opposition parties leveraging transparency and consistency critiques, while the coalition defended its stance on fiscal responsibility and the Dutch model. The tone was contentious yet procedural, with sarcasm and sharp exchanges underscoring underlying disagreements.",
